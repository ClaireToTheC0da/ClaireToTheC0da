- 👋 Hello! I’m @ClaireToTheC0da (Claire, they/them) and I am a queer, neurodivergent, disabled student programmer.
- ⌨️ I’m fluent in HMTL, CSS, and partially fluent in JavaScript and Java. These days, I mostly program for my school's FTC team.
- 🎼 In my (limited) free time, I also draw, write, play the cello and piano, and sing. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Email me at turtletastic998@gmail.com.
